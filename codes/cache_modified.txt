This test checks the correct functionality of the L1 data caches on the next cases:
1) Store a block and have it be as Modified in an L1 (straight from Invalid to Modified)
2) Store the same block as before and see that no transaction happens, as the block is already in the L1
3) Load the same block and check that its state does not change and no transactions are carried
4) Load a block as Shared and afterwards produce a store operation on the same block. Check that the block changes from Shared to Modified with no further transactions
5) On the last one (4) check also that the LLC invalidates the block as it is modified in some cache
