This test checks the correct functionality of L1 data caches on the next cases:
1) An L1 cache modifies a block, then another L1 modifies the same block thus:
	1.1) The first L1 begins a cache to cache transfer leaving the block as Invalid
	1.2) The LLC does not update the state of the block as another L1 has it as modified
